    "## Introduction\n",
    "# HotpotQA: Understanding Multi-hop Question Answering\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "HotpotQA represents a significant advancement in question answering research. Created in 2018 by researchers from Carnegie Mellon University, Stanford University, and Université de Montréal, this dataset was specifically designed to address limitations in existing question answering systems and push the boundaries of AI reasoning capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why HotpotQA Was Created\n",
    "\n",
    "HotpotQA was developed to address several critical limitations in existing question answering datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Limited Reasoning Capabilities**: Prior QA datasets primarily tested single-hop reasoning, where answers could be found in a single paragraph or even a single sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Lack of Explainability**: Most QA systems couldn't explain how they arrived at answers, functioning as \"black boxes.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Constrained by Knowledge Bases**: Many multi-hop datasets were built on structured knowledge bases with predefined schemas, limiting question diversity.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Insufficient Supervision**: Previous datasets provided only distant supervision (just the final answer), making it difficult for models to learn reasoning processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features of HotpotQA\n",
    "\n",
    "HotpotQA introduced several innovations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Multi-hop Reasoning**: Questions require finding and connecting information across multiple documents, mimicking how humans research complex topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Natural Language Diversity**: Not constrained by knowledge base schemas, allowing for more natural and diverse questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Supporting Facts Annotation**: Provides sentence-level supporting facts required for reasoning, enabling stronger supervision and explainable predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Comparison Questions**: Introduces a new type of question that requires comparing attributes of different entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Composition\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Size**: Approximately 113,000 question-answer pairs\n",
    "- **Source**: Based on Wikipedia articles\n",
    "- **Question Types**: \n",
    "  - Bridge questions (requiring finding intermediate entities)\n",
    "  - Comparison questions (comparing attributes of entities)\n",
    "- **Difficulty Levels**: Easy, Medium, Hard\n",
    "- **Benchmark Settings**:\n",
    "  - Distractor setting (10 paragraphs with 2 gold paragraphs)\n",
    "  - Full wiki setting (search entire Wikipedia)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Educational Implications\n",
    "\n",
    "HotpotQA is particularly valuable for teaching:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Complex Reasoning**: Students can develop step-by-step reasoning skills by understanding how to connect information from multiple sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Information Synthesis**: The dataset demonstrates how to combine facts from different documents to arrive at new conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Critical Evaluation**: By examining supporting facts, students learn to identify which pieces of information are relevant to answering questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Explainable AI**: The supporting facts annotation helps teach the importance of explainability in AI systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Question Types\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bridge Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "These questions require finding an intermediate entity (bridge) that connects information from two documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: \n",
    "> \"The Oberoi family is part of a hotel company that has a head office in what city?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This requires first finding that the Oberoi family is connected to \"The Oberoi Group\" (bridge entity), then discovering where the Oberoi Group headquarters is located.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "These questions require comparing attributes of different entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "> \"Were Pavel Urysohn and Leonid Levin both mathematicians?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This requires finding information about both individuals and comparing their professions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenges and Impact\n",
    "\n",
    "HotpotQA has become a benchmark for evaluating the reasoning capabilities of QA systems. Performance on this dataset measures a system's ability to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Find relevant documents\n",
    "2. Identify supporting facts\n",
    "3. Connect information across documents\n",
    "4. Provide accurate answers\n",
    "5. Explain the reasoning process\n",
    "\n",
    "The creation of HotpotQA has inspired numerous advances in multi-hop reasoning models and continues to influence the development of more sophisticated question answering systems.\n",
    "\n",
